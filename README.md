# TodoEr

## TodoList on steroids. 

Have you come across the need to reuse checklists and end up copy-pasting? Normal Todos do not allow you to create **Object Oriented** type `instances` of the checklists. 

In my efforts to get some hands-on with vue.js, I ended up creating a Todo List that solves this exact problem. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

**NOTE**: The app runs on browser only and stores data on the browser's `localStore`. Clearing cache/browsing data would result in loss of all settings/data. Export app configurations before clearing cache and use them back when starting over.
